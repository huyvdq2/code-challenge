# 99Tech Code Challenge Solutions

This repository contains comprehensive solutions to the 99Tech coding challenges, demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript algorithms, React development, and code quality practices.

## Repository Structure

### Problem 1: Sum to N Algorithms

**Location**: `src/problem1/`
**Language**: JavaScript
**Focus**: Algorithm implementation and performance optimization

Three different approaches to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n:

- Iterative approach using loops
- Mathematical formula implementation
- Recursive solution with edge case handling

### Problem 2: Currency Swap Application

**Location**: `src/problem2/`
**Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
**Focus**: Modern React development with enterprise-grade architecture

A production-ready cryptocurrency swap application featuring:

- Feature-based component architecture (container/pure pattern)
- Real-time currency conversion with mock API integration
- Comprehensive test suite (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Responsive design with custom UI components
- Form validation and error handling
- Swap history with persistent storage

### Problem 3: Code Review & Refactoring

**Location**: `src/problem3/`
**Language**: TypeScript/React
**Focus**: Code quality analysis and optimization

Identifies and fixes common React/TypeScript issues:

- Interface mismatches and type safety
- Performance optimizations (useMemo, useCallback)
- Component architecture improvements
- Dependency management and prop handling

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tools**: Vite, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Zustand stores
